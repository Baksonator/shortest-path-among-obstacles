The app is run in the browser (index.html). The starting and end points as well as the polygon obstacles are read from the files  points.xml and polygons.xml. It is important to list polygon points in a clockwise or counterclockwise direction (in a consecutive order). The algorithm is run in three stages, the first one is calculating the visibility graph. After that, clicking on a point will highlight all other points visible from it. The second stage is adding weight to edges in the visibility graph, every edge will have a weight corresponding to the Euclidean distance between the points it connects. The third and final stage is calculating the shortest path between the start and end point using Dijsktra'a algorithm.
